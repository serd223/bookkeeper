# Overview
`bookkeeper` is a tool inspired by the rust [`serde`](https://serde.rs/) crate and [this stream from Tsoding](https://youtu.be/hnM6aSpWJ8c?si=7WqJW0dy8oaJtdmm).

The `analyzer` executable scans the directory you supplied from the command line for any `.c` or `.h` files and searches through those files for any `typedef struct { /* fields */ } Name;` style struct definitions. After collecting and parsing all struct definitions, `analyzer` generates a `.c` file named `bookkeeper.c` that contains functions like `dump_$type$($type$* item, char* dst)` and `parse_$type$($type$* item, char* src)`. These functions parse/dump JSON representations of its associated type from/to the supplied buffer. There are plans to extend this system to allow for schemas other than JSON (just like `serde`) but getting JSON to work first is the priority.
