# Overview
`bookkeeper` is a tool inspired by the rust [`serde`](https://serde.rs/) crate and [this stream from Tsoding](https://youtu.be/hnM6aSpWJ8c?si=7WqJW0dy8oaJtdmm).

# Usage
The `bookkeeper_gen` tool accepts an optional search path (defaults to './examples' for demonstration purposes) and optional flags. It scans the search path for any `.c` or `.h` files and collects all `typedef struct { field_type field; } StructName` style struct definitions inside those files. Each struct can 'derive' functionalities that will be included in the generated code. For instance, if you want your struct to support JSON parsing/dumping you would write:

```c
typedef struct {
    int some_field;
    const char* some_other_field;
} StructName derive_json();
```
(See [people.h](https://github.com/serd223/bookkeeper/blob/master/examples/people.h))

Note that you can use the optional `--derive-all` flag while invoking `bookkeeper_gen` to derive all possible derives for every struct.

`derive_json` is a macro that is included inside the `bookkeeper.h` file generated by `bookkeeper_gen`. So, to use the 'derive' functionality you will need to run `bookkeeper_gen` to actually acquire the `bookkeeper.h` file that includes the `derive_json` definition. `bookkeeper_gen` also generates a file called `bookkeeper.c` which contains the implementations of the generated parsing/dumping functions for your structs. Generated functions look like this:
```c
void dump_$schema$_$type$($type$* item, void* dst) {
    /* generated impl */
}
```
Dump functions use a macro named `BK_FMT` defined inside `bookkeeper.c` to output into the provided `dst` buffer. The `void* dst` that is accepted through the `dump` family of functions is directly passed to `BK_FMT` so the underlying type of `dst` depends on your `BK_FMT` implementation. The default implementation uses `sprintf` and expects `dst` to be `char*` but it can be redefined inside your code before including `bookkeeper.c`.

# Build Instructions
You can build `bookkeeper_gen` by cloning this repository and running: (requires [clang](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html))
```console
    $ make
```

If you want to build the `dump_people` example, run: (requires [clang](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html))
```console
    $ make dump_people
```
The `dump_people` target automatically generates the necessary `bookkeeper` files.
